# Simple Node.js application to demonstrate usage of [request-multiple-urls package](https://github.com/UsabilitySoft/request-multiple-urls.git)

## This will predominently install:

* **babel** required to resolve import. I was having trouble with default export using TypeScript.
* **nodemon** to run application easily.
* **request-multiple-urls** code test package.

## Usage

**From the command line:**

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run start` to start the application.

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

The application should display the resulting content of multiple URLs.
